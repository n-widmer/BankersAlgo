# BankersAlgo
Bankers algorithm for Operating Systems

// Here is my code for completing the bankers algorithm. I created three different text files which the program reads the input from. This code correctly allocates resources to a process based on the maximum needed and allocated resources. It also provides the user with the safe sequence printed to the screen after execution. I also created a seperate execution file called "out" which you will need to run in order to execute the program.

The compiling command for this code is "g++ bankers.cpp"

the running command for this code is "./out"
